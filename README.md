# Python-UIT-Narvik
## Information
This is the Repository for my previous school projects and assignments written in Python.
All the assignments are for a Machine learning course, and python itself was never the goal of the course.

### Disruption
There could be missing code, inconsistencies or errors in the code, as not all code has not been checked in a while. 
All code should run. 

## Content
The course contains some assignments that is purely python oriented to get a feel for what the language is, so that the student wont have any issue stating the course.
The rest of the content is focused on machine learning and noise filters. Two being Kalman Alpha and Beta filters.
As well as a pathfinding algorithm known as A*

## Book
No book used.
